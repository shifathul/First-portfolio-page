Portfolio Website

This is a basic portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. It currently includes the following pages:

Home Page – An introduction about me and my work.

Contact Page – A simple contact form with basic styling.


This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn how to structure a basic website and apply simple CSS styling. More pages and features may be added in the future as I continue to develop my skills.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or fork the repository!
